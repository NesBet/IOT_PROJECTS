# ESP32 Web Server in Arduino IDE: Control LEDs

In this tutorial, we will learn to create a simple web server with ESP32 using Arduino IDE. This ESP32 web server controls GPIO pins or LEDs whenever it receives an HTTP GET request from a web client ( web browser). To access the web server, ESP32 should be connected with the same WiFi network to which your mobile or computer is connected.

## Setting up Arduino IDE

We will be using Arduino IDE to program our ESP32 development board. Before we move ahead, make sure you have the latest version of Arduino installed on your computer. Moreover, you should also have an ESP32 add-on in Arduino IDE. You can check this tutorial:

## ESP32 Web Server Project Overview

You will learn the following in this ESP32 web server tutorial:

-   Learn to make a web server using ESP32 and Arduino IDE
-   How to make a web server to control LEDs from a local network using an ESP32
-   What is a web server? How to use ESP32 as a Web server
-   How an ESP32 web server can serve HTML, CSS, and Javascript files to web clients by acting as a server.

## Introducing Web server?

When we talk about web server in the context of the internet of things, the web server is nothing but the location where our website files stores and Web server process these files to clients based on the request of a client. Website files are web pages of any site. Like you are using this website to read an article on how to make an EPS32 web server, this webpage is stored in a server of our hosting company. So when you click on the link to open this article, you request a client to a server of our hosting company.

After receiving this particular page request, our hosting company server processes this request to display this webpage. Similarly, we can use ESP32 as a host for storing web pages, and when someone requests a web page through a local network, esp32 will serve this webpage. The picture below provides a view of client-server based communication.

[![client and server](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/client-and-server.png)](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/client-and-server.png)

### Web Serve and Client Communication

This is a basic idea of server and client-based communication over the internet. Now the question is how can we establish communication between client and Web server? HTTP which is also known as hypertext transfer control is a protocol that is used to transfer data between the web client and Web server. The web server in this tutorial will be ESP32 and the web client will be any web browser or Android application. Whenever a web client needs to access any web files, it starts an HTTP GET request to the web server.

### How Does a Web Server respond to a Client Request?

After receiving HTTP GET request, the server responds with web pages. The web server also responds through the HTTP protocol. If web files are not available on Server or it is down due to some technical reasons, you will see a message of error 404 on the web browser. In the above figure, there is only one client and one server. But a server can connect to multiple web clients and service requests through HTTP protocol. Web server is also known as Server host which listen to other web clients and service the requests.

## ESP32 modes of operations

Many people think that It can be used as station mode only where it can connect to an existing network. But This WiFi module has very important features to use a soft access point mode, station mode and both modes at the same time. In this tutorial, I will talk about station mode only. In the next tutorials, I will also write about how to use this board in soft access mode. Lets now see the difference between the station mode and the soft access mode.

### Station mode or STA

In this mode, ESP32 board connects to your WiFi network through a router. So the medium of communication between the web client and ESP32 is the router. It gets the IP address from the Wifi router. With this IP address, web clients can access the Web server through an existing local network.

![ESP32 ESP8266 station mode](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ESP32-ESP8266-station-mode.jpg)

### Soft access point mode

In this mode, ESP32 used to create its own wireless WiFi network similar to your existing WiFi router. In this mode, we do not need to connect ESP2 to WiFi network. Up to 5 devices can connect to this Wifi network created by this WiFi board.


![ESP32 ESP8266 Soft access point](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ESP32-ESP8266-Soft-access-point.jpg)

## How to use ESP32 as a Web Server in station mode

So now I will explain how to it as a station mode to create a web server. We can turn any computer windows or Linux into a web server. But your computer should remain connected to the internet all the time. Similarly, we can use the ESP32 development board as a host server.

![](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ESP32-webserver-as-server-host.jpg)

### Getting IP Address

We can have multiple clients and a single host server like ESP32 or any IOT development board. So now the question is how a web client can access the ESP32 based web server? When we connect any device to the network, the IP address is assigned to it. So we can use this assigned IP address to refer to this device. For example, when we connect ESP32 development board to network, the IP address will be given to it. We will use this IP address to access the ESP32 server over the web browser.

[![ESP32 IP address](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ESP32-IP-address.jpg)](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ESP32-IP-address.jpg)

### How to Access the Web Page?

To access ESP32 web pages, we need to get its IP address which is assigned to it when it connects to the internet. In the programming part, I will show you how to get its IP address.

After getting the IP address, simply place it in a web browser, you will get the response from the ESP32 host server. For example, the web files which we stored in ESP32 are like the one shown below. It will show this web file in your web browser.

![](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ESP32-webserver-web-page.jpg)

Uptill now, we have learned about web server and how ESP32 can be used as web server.

## ESP32 Web Server To Control GPIOs

Now we see how to control three light-emitting diodes or LEDs over a web server. We can access this server on any web browser installed on the personal computer, laptop, mobile device or tablet. Now we will be controlling two LEDs through a web browser. We will be using three light emitting diodes in this tutorial. Now make this schematic shown below on breadboard. Connection diagram shows which general-purpose input-output pins we have used. But you can use any GPIO pin you want. Remember this tutorial is for demonstration only, in the actual project, you will use  [relays](https://microcontrollerslab.com/electromechanical-relays-interfacing-with-microcontrollers/)  to control ac devices, like  [home automation project](https://microcontrollerslab.com/ethernet-based-home-automation-project/). Project on home automation will also be published on our blog in the coming article.

### Schematic Diagram

[![ESP32 web server controlling LEDs circuit diagram](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ESP32-web-server-controlling-LEDs-circuit-diagram-1024x452.jpg)](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ESP32-web-server-controlling-LEDs-circuit-diagram.jpg)

### Components list

To make this schematic, you will need the following components :

-   Breadboard
-   ESP32 board ( we are using ESP32 devkit DOIT 30 pin version)
-   three 100 ohm resistors
-   Jumper wires
-   3 LEDs

In the schematic, we are using GPIO pins 15, 22, and 23 as digital output pins. These pins are connected with  light-emitting diodes through current limiting resistors. For more information about how to interface LED with this board, you can check  LED blinking with ESP32 article. LED1 is connected with GPIO pin 23. LED2 is connected with GPIO pin 22 and LED3 is connected with GPIO pin fifteen.

### ESP32 Web server Arduino Code

Now, let’s move to the main part of the ESP32 web server tutorial, the programming section. Remember in this tutorial we are using this Wifi module in station mode. This Arduino code controls three LEDs with separate on and off buttons. After building the circuit diagram upload this code to Arduino IDE.

```c
#include <WiFi.h>

```

### Uploading Code to ESP32

Follow these steps to upload code after copying this code to Arduino IDE.

-   First of all, you need to add the name of your WiFi network and password to the following two lines:

```c
const char* WIFI_NAME= "Enter your WiFi name here"; 
const char* WIFI_PASSWORD = "Enter password of WiFi here";
```

You don’t need to make any other changes in the code. Now first compile your code by clicking on the verify button on the Arduino IDE. ESP32 codes usually take more time to compile than other microcontrollers, so don’t worry about it and wait for a while. After it’s done with compilation, it will show the following message in the compilation window.

![](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ESP32-webserver-code-compilation.jpg)

Now click on upload button to upload this code into ESP32 WROOM chip.

![](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/UPLOAD-BUTTON-ARDUINO-IDE.jpg)

Before uploading the program, make sure you should have select the right COM port to which your board is connected.

![](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Selecting-COM-PORT-ESP32.jpg)

Also, you should select the ESP32 dev module from the tools and boards menu as shown below:

![](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ESP32-dev-module-selection-for-webserver.jpg)

After you see the message of done uploading on Arduino IDE, open the serial monitor by clicking on the serial monitor option. Select the baud rate of 115200 in the serial monitor window.

![](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SERIAL-MONITOR-ARDUINO-IDE.jpg)

After the code will be upload successfully, you will see this message :

![](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/after-upload-ESP32-server-code.jpg)

### Getting IP address

Now, open the serial monitor and click on the reset button of the ESP32 dev kit board. you will see the message ” trying to connect to a WiFi network” and after some time you will see the message “successfully connected to WiFi network” and also the IP address as shown in the figure below:

![](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ESP32-webserver-IP-address.jpg)

### Accessing ESP32 Web Server

Now we will see how to open the web page which is stored in ESP32 board. To access the web server, paste the IP address which we noted in the last step in any web browser. You will find this web page in your browser.[![accessing ESP32 webserver](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/accessing-ESP32-webserver-1024x549.jpg)](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/accessing-ESP32-webserver.jpg)

### How ESP32 Web server works?

After accessing a web page through a web browser, you can check the serial monitor where you will see the web page HTTP GET request from a client over HTTP protocol. You will see this message on the serial monitor.

New Client is requesting web page
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.10.47
Connection: keep-alive
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/72.0.3626.121 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
AlexaToolbar-ALX_NS_PH: AlexaToolbar/alx-4.0.3

This is a message which defines the operating parameters for the transaction of an HTTP request by the client and for the service of the web page by the station. But we don’t need to worry about this. The actual concept which we need to understand is what happens when someone presses on/off buttons to trigger LED on and off. So now let’s see what happens on the browser and what message goes to the ESP32 board which we display on a serial monitor.

#### Controlling LEDs from web page

When you press an LED0 button, you will see that the IP address will now contain an additional text “/?LED0=ON” and this message will be sent to the ESP32 board. you will also see the message in the string “GET /?LED0=ON HTTP/1.1″ . So ESP32 will receive this request from the web client and turn on the LED0 which we specified in the code given above. I will explain this part in the section ” How code works”. you also notice the state of LED will be shown on the web page. Similarly, you can test other buttons and check the same response.

[![Webserver LED0 ON](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Webserver-LED0-ON-1024x846.jpg)](https://microcontrollerslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Webserver-LED0-ON.jpg)

So you should follow these points while testing web server.

-   First, you should press each button and check if you see the same message in the URL and also on the serial monitor of Arduino IDE.
-   Also check, if the state of the LED message is changing according to the button you pressed on the web page.
-   Also see, if the respective LED is toggling according to the pressed button.

### How Does the ESP32 Web Server Code work?

Now we will see how this code work and I will provide you details of function and each line of the code.

WiFi.h is a library of WiFi module. We will include this library because we will be using the WiFi function to connect to a network, to send data to the client and to receive data from the client. This library is pre-installed in Arduino IDE. So, we will just include it with the #include directive.

```c
#include <WiFi.h>
```

#### Connect to WiFi

These two variables are used to store name and password of the Network to which you want to connect your ESP32 board. You should replace “ PTCL-BBB” with your wireless feudality network name and also put the password in WIFI_password variable.

```c
const char* WIFI_NAME= "PTCL-BB"; 
const char* WIFI_PASSWORD = "5387c614";
```

Whenever we set Web server, when need to define its ports name, this line will set the WiFiServer() at port 80.

```c
WiFiServer server(80);
```

This string variable name is used to store all the data received by ESP32 development board through HTTP requests.

```c
String header;
```

#### Define LEDs

As I mentioned, we are toggling three LEDs in this tutorial, so these three variables are used to store the state of these three lights emitting diodes. Initially, we set the state of LEDs to off state. But these states will change according to the status of LEDs.

```c
String LED_ONE_STATE = "off";
String LED_TWO_STATE = "off";
String LED_THREE_STATE = "off";
```

GPIO pins 22, 23 and 15 are used with LEDs. So, these three statements will give the name to these GPIO pins. Whenever we want to refer to these pins in our code, we will use them by these name instead of the pin number.

```c
const int GPIO_PIN_NUMBER_22 = 22;
const int GPIO_PIN_NUMBER_23 = 23;
const int GPIO_PIN_NUMBER_15 = 15;

```

In setup() function first, we initialized the baud rate of ‘serial.begin’ function at the rate of 115200 bits per second.

```c
Serial.begin(115200);
```

Now we define these GPIO pins as digital output using pinMode() function and also set these general purpose input output pins to digitally low using digitalWrite() function.

```c
  pinMode(GPIO_PIN_NUMBER_22, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(GPIO_PIN_NUMBER_23, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(GPIO_PIN_NUMBER_15, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(GPIO_PIN_NUMBER_22, LOW);
  digitalWrite(GPIO_PIN_NUMBER_23, LOW);
  digitalWrite(GPIO_PIN_NUMBER_15, LOW);
```

Now, We will discuss some of the functions from WiFi library which are used in this course. So that you can understand code more clearly.

#### Connecting to WiFi

First, it will print a message “connecting to ” along with WiFi name. After that, it will connect to a network. If it is successfully connected to a wifi network. you will see an IP address and successfully to connect to a Wifi network message on Serial monitor. While it is trying to connect to the internet, it will show ” trying to connect to wifi network. Server.begin () function start the server and now any web client can access the web page with this IP address.

```c
Serial.print("Connecting to ");
Serial.println(WIFI_NAME);
WiFi.begin(WIFI_NAME, WIFI_PASSWORD);
while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED)

 {
delay(1000);
Serial.print("Trying to connect to Wifi Network");
}
Serial.println("");
Serial.println("Successfully connected to WiFi network");
Serial.println("IP address: ");
Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
server.begin();
```

Main loop service the web page to the client and also receive data through HTTP get request about the status of GPIO pins. Inside the loop function, this line is used to receive a request from new web clients. If the client request is available, server.avaialble () function stores logical one value in variable client.

```c
WiFiClient client = server.available();
```

Now if the client request is available, These statements will start receiving data from the client and stores the data in header string and it will continue receiving data until ‘\n’ is not found which means client has disconnected.

```c
if (client) 

{ 
Serial.println("New Client is requesting web page"); 
String current_data_line = ""; 
while (client.connected()) { 
if (client.available()) { 
char new_byte = client.read(); 
Serial.write(new_byte); 
header += new_byte;
if (new_byte == '\n') { 

if (current_data_line.length() == 0) 
{

client.println("HTTP/1.1 200 OK");
client.println("Content-type:text/html");
client.println("Connection: close");
client.println();
```

#### Controlling LEDs Code

Now based on the received data from the client which we stored in a string ‘header’, we will toggle the respective LED on and off. These conditions will check if the button is pressed or not on. If LED0 button is pressed, as we have seen previously, we will get a message of ‘?LED0=0N” from client and we will save this message in header string. These lines use header.indexof () function which checks if a specific string is available in the header or not, if available, it will turn on and turn off the respective digital pin and also change the status of the LED which will be updated on the Web server. We have three buttons and each button has two states. Therefore here we have six if conditions to check what is received in header string.

```c
if (header.indexOf("LED0=ON") != -1) 
{
Serial.println("GPIO23 LED is ON");
LED_ONE_STATE = "on";
digitalWrite(GPIO_PIN_NUMBER_22, HIGH);
} 
if (header.indexOf("LED0=OFF") != -1) 
{
Serial.println("GPIO23 LED is OFF");
LED_ONE_STATE = "off";
digitalWrite(GPIO_PIN_NUMBER_22, LOW);
} 
if (header.indexOf("LED1=ON") != -1)
{
Serial.println("GPIO23 LED is ON");
LED_TWO_STATE = "on";
digitalWrite(GPIO_PIN_NUMBER_23, HIGH);
}
if (header.indexOf("LED1=OFF") != -1) 
{
Serial.println("GPIO23 LED is OFF");
LED_TWO_STATE = "off";
digitalWrite(GPIO_PIN_NUMBER_23, LOW);
}
if (header.indexOf("LED2=ON") != -1) 
{
Serial.println("GPIO15 LED is ON");
LED_THREE_STATE = "on";
digitalWrite(GPIO_PIN_NUMBER_15, HIGH);
}
if(header.indexOf("LED2=OFF") != -1) {
Serial.println("GPIO15 LED is OFF");
LED_THREE_STATE = "off";
digitalWrite(GPIO_PIN_NUMBER_15, LOW);
}
```

#### Displaying HTML on web server

Next part of the program is to display HTML and CSS code to the web browser. This client.println () function is used to send HTML and CSS commands to the client who is accessing a web server through an IP address. This HTML file we wan to send to a client. You can find further details of HTML and CSS on this  [link](https://www.w3schools.com/).

```c
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head>
<style>
.button {
background-color: #4CAF50;
border: 2px solid #4CAF50;;
color: white;
padding: 15px 32px;
text-align: center;
text-decoration: none;
display: inline-block;
font-size: 16px;
margin: 4px 2px;
cursor: pointer;
}
</style>
</head>
<body> 
<center><h1 style="color:blue;">ESP32 Web server LED controlling example</h1></center> 
<center><h2 style="color:black;">Web Server Example Microcontrollerslab.com</h2></center> 
<center><h2 style="color:Green;">Press "ON" button to turn on led and "OFF" button to turn off LED</h3></center> 
<form> 
<center>
<button class="button" name="LED0" value="ON" type="submit">LED0 ON</button> 
<button class="button" name="LED0" value="OFF" type="submit">LED0 OFF</button><br><br> 
<button class="button" name="LED1" value="ON" type="submit">LED1 ON</button> 
<button class="button" name="LED1" value="OFF" type="submit">LED1 OFF</button> <br><br>
<button class="button" name="LED2" value="ON" type="submit">LED2 ON</button> 
<button class="button" name="LED2" value="OFF" type="submit">LED2 OFF</button> 
</center>
</form> 
</body> 
</html>
```

-   We will serve this HTML and CSS file to a web client through ESP32. Whenever any web client try to access the web page through an IP address, we will send this HTML page.
-   Buttons are used to control LEDs. Whenever a web client press the button, we receive a HTTP request. Based on the HTTP request, we take action and control the LEDs.

#### Displaying web page with ESP32

But we can send it through client.println() function only. So now let’s see how to set up web page through ESP32. This line will show that we want to send HTML file.

```c
client.println("<!DOCTYPE html><html>");
```

This line is used because we want to make our web page accessible on every device like a computer, laptop, mobile, and tablet and it will make the web page responsive.

```c
client.println("<head><meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">");
```

These lines are used to give style and colors to texts and buttons used on the webpage. They make the appearance of the web page better. For in this line, we are using font-family Helvetica and set the color of a web page as default which we can change later and also set the text to the center of the page.

```c
client.println("<style>html { font-family: Helvetica; display: inline-block; margin: 0px auto; text-align: center;}");
```

To give style to buttons and also color, this line will set the background color of green and border-color black and text color white. It also sets padding, text alignment and font size of the text used inside the buttons.

```c
client.println(".button { background-color: #4CAF50; border: 2px solid #4CAF50;; color: white; padding: 15px 32px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; font-size: 16px; margin: 4px 2px; cursor: pointer; }");
client.println("text-decoration: none; font-size: 30px; margin: 2px; cursor: pointer;}");
```

These code statements print the heading parts of the code and display a text message on server.

```c
client.println("</style></head>");
client.println("<body><center><h1>ESP32 Web server LED controlling example</h1></center>");
client.println("<center><h2>Web Server Example Microcontrollerslab.com</h2></center>" );
client.println("<center><h2>Press on button to turn on led and off button to turn off LED</h3></center>");
client.println("<form><center>");
```

#### HTML Code to display Button and LED status

This part is used to display buttons and also the status of LEDs on a web page.

```c
client.println("<p> LED one is " + LED_ONE_STATE + "</p>");
// If the PIN_NUMBER_22State is off, it displays the ON button
client.println("<center> <button class=\"button\" name=\"LED0\" value=\"ON\" type=\"submit\">LED0 ON</button>") ;
client.println("<button class=\"button\" name=\"LED0\" value=\"OFF\" type=\"submit\">LED0 OFF</button><br><br>");
client.println("<p>LED two is " + LED_TWO_STATE + "</p>");
client.println("<button class=\"button\" name=\"LED1\" value=\"ON\" type=\"submit\">LED1 ON</button>");
client.println("<button class=\"button\" name=\"LED1\" value=\"OFF\" type=\"submit\">LED1 OFF</button> <br><br>");
client.println("<p>LED three is " + LED_THREE_STATE + "</p>");
client.println ("<button class=\"button\" name=\"LED2\" value=\"ON\" type=\"submit\">LED2 ON</button>");
client.println ("<button class=\"button\" name=\"LED2\" value=\"OFF\" type=\"submit\">LED2 OFF</button></center>");
client.println("</center></form></body></html>");
client.println();
```
### Arduino WiFi Functions

Details of the functions used in this code are given below:

-   WifiSever(): This procedure is used to create a server that is used to listen to incoming HTTP requests from the web client.
-   WiFi.begin(ssid, password): This function is initialized the WiFi library with two arguments as an input to this function. The first argument is the name of the network and the second argument is the password of the wireless network.
-   WiFi.connected(): This function check either ESP32 is connected to network or not. It will return the status as TRUE or FALSE depending on the connection.
-   WiFilocalIP(): If ESP32 is successfully connected with a network, we can use this function to get the IP address which is assigned to the board.
-   server.begin(): It will tell start the connection to the web client and start receiving requests from the Web clients.
