# LED Control Using Switch

## AIM:

To display time on LCD Display using Arduino

## Purpose:

We can make note of time, using Real Time Clock Module.

## Short Description:

**Requirements:**

- Arduino UNO
- 16 X 2 LCD Display
- RTC DS3231 Module
- Power Adapters
- 1OK Potentiometer
- Jumper Wires/Connectors
- Arduino Cable

## Workflow:

- First we initialise the RTC Module with current Date and Time.
- Initialise the LCD Display
- Create a loop to update date and time accordingly, and display the same in LCD Display
- Addition of sending output to the serial monitor too

## Setup instructions:

- Assemble the circuit as shown in the Schematic Diagram.
- Make sure to check the pinouts of LCD as well as the RTC Module
