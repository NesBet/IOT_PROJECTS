# Combination Lock using Arduino
## Aim
To develop a combination lock using arduino with push buttons and LEDs
## Purpose
Combination lock using arduino. Includes push buttons and LED's for interaction

## Components Used
- LED's
- Push Buttons
- Arduino Board
- wires
## Workflow:

- We inititialise required variables/constants and assign pins on the arduino board.
- In setup, we set the states of variables defined. 
- We initiate a loop. Each time a push button is clicked, the corresponding LED glows.
- On reaching the end of input, program detects if the combination used is correct or not. Depending on that, the green led glows if there is a successful unlock.
