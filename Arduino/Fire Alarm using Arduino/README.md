# Aim
To detect the fire and alerting at real time.
<br>

# Purpose
To avoid severe casualities.
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Tinkercad
Arduino UNO
LCD 16 x 2 
Wires
Resistor 220 ohms 
Potentiometer 250 kilo-ohms
Piezo
IR Sensor
LED
<br>


# Workflow
We have completed the setup as per the given images mnetioned in the '/images/'<br>
We take the input for infrared sensor checks whether the input taken consists of flame, if then alerts by piezo and led system. For demonstration purpose we have taken input in serial port to check for the no-flame part as well.
<br>

# Setup 
Connect the circuit diagram as shown in the image and press the simulation button then change the values for infrared sensor to know the gist of the project.
