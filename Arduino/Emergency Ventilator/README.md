# Aim
To make a Ventilator using day to day component.
<br>

# Purpose
To make ventilator in affordable cost.
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Tinkercad
Arduino UNO
LCD 16 x 2 
Wires
Resistor 220 ohms 
Potentiometer 250 kilo-ohms
Piezo
Servo Motor
<br>


# Workflow
We have completed the setup as per the given images mentioned in the '/images/'<br>
We take the input for the potentiometer check for various values, the potentiometer value for volume is less than particular value or too less then variety of frequencies are implemented same done for breathes per minute (BPM), according to the values of BPM and Volume the servo motor rotates as per the requirement.
<br>

# Setup 
Connect the circuit diagram as shown in the image and press the simulation button then change the values of potentiometer to know the gist of the project.
