# Aim
To Alter the Brightness of the Led using arduino
<br>

# Purpose
change brightness of the led
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Tinkercad
Arduino UNO
Led
Wires
Resistor 220 ohms 
Potentiometer 220 ohms
<br>


# Workflow
Led is output and potentiometer is input device.
when potentiometer is rotated, value is stored in a variable and according to that the brightness of led is altered from 0 to 255.
<br>

# Setup 
Connect the circuit diagram as shown in the image and press the simulation button then rotate potentiometer to change the brightness of Led
