# Temperature sensing using Arduino
## AIM:
To get the temperature using arduino

## Purpose:
To update the temperature in degree celcius in every second.

## Component Required:
- Arduino UNO R3
- breadboard
- wires
- Temperature sensor [TMP36]
(Tinkercad can also be used.)

## Workflow:
- We initiate a loop
- A delay of 1s is added.
