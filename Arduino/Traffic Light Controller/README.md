# Traffic Light Controller


## Aim

This project is a simple the traffic light controller for three way using Arduino. Traffic lights allow everyone to cross the intersection point one by one, reducing conflicts between vehicles entering intersection points from different directions. 


## Purpose

We use three set of traffic light which are placed on respective three paths. Our purpose is to allow vehicles from one path and keep the others stop at a time. 


## Components Required

| Components  |      Quantity |  Range|
|----------   |:-------------:|------:|
| Arduino Uno |  1            |   -   |
| LEDs        |3 R, 3 Y, 3 G  |   -   |
| Resistor    |     3         |220ohm |
|wires        | -             | -     |


## Short description of package/script

- In the project, we have exhibited traffic lights for a three-way road. The LEDs will be glowing in a particular sequence to form an actual traffic light controller system.
- Tool: Tinkercad software

## Workflow of the Project

- In the void setup of the code, we have defined the pins for the LEDs as outputs from 2 to 10. In the void loop section, we have defined the functions to turn LEDs ON and OFF into the sequence.
- At a time, 2 RED and 1 YELLOW for a second. Then YELLOW turns into GREEN for 5 second. This happens with another both sets of traffic light. It performs in a loop.


## Setup instructions

- Connect LEDs on the breadboard as Red, Yellow, Green, respectively.
- Connect the negative terminal of the LED and connect the 220 Ohm resistor in series.
- Connect these negative terminals to the ground.
- Connect the positive terminal of the LEDs to the pins 2 to 10, respectively.
- Power the breadboard by using 5V and GND on the Arduino
