# Printing IR remote input on LCD screen.

## Aim

To print IR remote input on LCD screen.

## Purpose

We will learn how to use IR Remote with LCD screen.


## Components Required
- LCD Screen 16*2
- IR Remote
- IR Sensor
- Resistor
- Arduino UNO
- Breadboard
- Wires
- Potentiometer


## Short Description 

- I am using an IR remote to take input, IR sensor to store and identify the input and LCD screen to print it.
When simulation is started and any button is pressed on the IR remote, IR sensor will interpret the input. Corresponding to that input and according to the code, Output will get printed on LCD Screen.

## Workflow of the Project

- When the simulation is started and any button on IR remote is pressed, we can see the corresponding output on LCD screen.
IR sensor detects the which button is pressed and provides specific value assigned to that button to LCD. LCD then prints message on screen corresponding to that button 

## Setup instructions

- Use Tinkercad
- Setup a circuit as shown in the circuit diagram in images folder
- Write the code as given
- Start simulation
- Press any button
- See the print on LCD screen
