# LED Control Using Potentiometer

## AIM:

To control the brightness of the LED alternatively using Potentiometer

## Purpose:

Brightness of LED can be controlled using the Potentiometer.

## Short Description:

**Requirements:**

- Arduino UNO
- 1 LED
- 1 Potentiometer
- 1 Resistor
- USB
  (Tinkercad can also be used)

## Workflow:

- We initiate a loop
- We read the value of the voltage across the Potentiometer
- We modify the value and provide it as input to the LED
- Using varied values by varying the resistance of the potentiometer, we control the state of the LED.

## Setup instructions:

- Assemble the circuit as shown below.
- Make sure to connect one end of both LED and potentiometer to ground(i.e. GND)
- Upload the code provided
- Run to see the project in action!
