# Aim
To detect the Humidity
<br>

# Purpose
Helpful to know the changing humidity level
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Tinkercad
Arduino UNO
LCD 16 x 2 
Wires
Resistor 220 ohms 
Potentiometer 250 kilo-ohms
Neopixel
<br>


# Workflow
We have completed the setup as per the given images mnetioned in the '/images/'<br>
We take the analog input for sensor through pin A0 and map it accordingly then call out user-defined setcolor function wherein we declare various color parameters for various instances of humidity and print the humidity type according to the humidity standards in serial port.
<br>

# Setup 
Connect the circuit diagram as shown in the image and press the simulation button then change the values for potentiometer to know the humidity.
