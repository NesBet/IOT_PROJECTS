# ESP32/ESP8266 HTTP Authentication Web Server (Username and Password Protected)

In this tutorial, we will learn how to add HTTP authentication in our ESP32/ESP8266 web servers build with the ESPAsyncWebServer library. User can only access the web server with an IP address if he has a correct username and IP password.

## HTTP Authentication Introduction

As we have seen in our previous projects that the ESP32 and ESP8266 Web servers are accessible through an IP address which anyone can get access to. Therefore, password protection is extremely vital to make your webpage secure otherwise anyone can access your server.

If want to make your web server confidential by adding password login information, this tutorial will help you to add the password to your web server. It will make your web server protected and will be accessible through a password and user name only.

To make our project easy to understand, we will create a simple web server to control the onboard LED of ESP32/ESP8266 in Arduino IDE. Password protection and logout features will be included through HTTP authentication.

## Prerequisites

You should have the latest version of Arduino IDE. Additionally, you also need to install the ESP32 and the ESP8266 plugin. If your IDE does not have the plugins installed you can visit the link below:


Moreover, you can also have a look at previously uploaded tutorials regarding webservers in ESP32/ESP8266 using Arduino IDE.

## Project Overview – HTTP Authentication Web Server

In this tutorial, we will add password protection to an asynchronous web server. The webserver will consist of a title ESP WEB SERVER, a logout button, text representing the state of the onboard LED and a sliding button to toggle the LED.

-   Firstly, we will upload our Arduino sketch to our ESP board.
-   Then, we will receive an IP address in our serial monitor.
-   Secondly, we will copy that IP address in a web browser and press enter. Previously, without any password protection, the webserver would have loaded but not this time. This time we will receive a window that will ask for the username and password.
-   Upon entering the correct credentials, we will get access to the web page.
-   Inside the web page, you will also find a logout button. By clicking it you will be redirected to the logout page.
-   To access the webserver again you will need to log in again.
-   The web server can be accessed on multiple devices only through a correct set of user name and password.

## Setting up Arduino IDE

### Installing ESPAsyncWebServer Library and Async TCP/ ESP Async TCP Library

We will need two libraries to build our web server.

-   ESPAsyncWebServer & AsyncTCP for ESP32.
-   ESPAsyncwebServer & ESPAsyncTCP for ESP8266.

The ESPAsyncWebServer library will help us in creating our web server easily. With this library, we will set up an asynchronous HTTP server. AsyncTCP (for ESP32 only) and ESPAsyncTCP (for ESP8266 only) library will also be incorporated as it a dependency for the ESPAsyncWebServer library. All of these libraries are not available in the Arduino library manager. Therefore, we will have to download and load them on our ESP32/ESP8266 board ourselves.

#### For ESP32 & ESP8266

-   To install the ESPAsyncWebServer library for free, [click here to download](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer/archive/master.zip). You will download the library as a .zip folder which you will extract and rename as ‘ESPAsyncWebServer.’ Then, transfer this folder to the installation library folder in your Arduino IDE.
#### For ESP8266 Only

-   To install the ESPAsync TCP library for free,  [click here to download](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP). You will download the library as a .zip folder which you will extract and rename as ‘ESPAsyncTCP.’ Then, transfer this folder to the installation library folder in your Arduino IDE.

Likewise, you can also go to  **Sketch > Include Library > Add .zip Library** inside the IDE to add the libraries as well. After installation of the libraries, restart your IDE.

## Arduino Sketch HTTP Authentication Web Server

Open your Arduino IDE and go to File > New to open a new file. Copy the code given below in that file. This code will work for both ESP32 and ESP8266 development boards. You just have to replace the network credentials and have to assign the username and password.

```c
#ifdef ESP32
  #include <WiFi.h>
  #include <AsyncTCP.h>
#else
  #include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
  #include <ESPAsyncTCP.h>
#endif
#include <ESPAsyncWebServer.h>

// Replace with your network credentials
const char* ssid = "PTCL-BB";
const char* password = "44332211";

const char* http_username = "admin";
const char* http_password = "admin";

const char* PARAM_INPUT_1 = "state";

const int output = 2;

// Create AsyncWebServer object on port 80
AsyncWebServer server(80);

 
// Replaces placeholder with button section in your web page
String processor(const String& var){
  //Serial.println(var);
  if(var == "BUTTONPLACEHOLDER"){
    String buttons ="";
    String outputStateValue = outputState();
    buttons+= "<p><label class=\"switch\"><input type=\"checkbox\" onchange=\"toggleCheckbox(this)\" id=\"output\" " + outputStateValue + "><span class=\"slider\"></span></label></p>";
    return buttons;
  }
  if (var == "STATE"){
    if(digitalRead(output)){
      return "ON";
    }
    else {
      return "OFF";
    }
  }
  return String();
}

String outputState(){
  if(digitalRead(output)){
    return "checked";
  }
  else {
    return "";
  }
  return "";
}

void setup(){
  // Serial port for debugging purposes
  Serial.begin(115200);

  pinMode(output, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(output, LOW);
  
  // Connect to Wi-Fi
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(1000);
    Serial.println("Connecting to WiFi..");
  }

  // Print ESP Local IP Address
  Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());

  // Route for root / web page
  server.on("/", HTTP_GET, [](AsyncWebServerRequest *request){
    if(!request->authenticate(http_username, http_password))
      return request->requestAuthentication();
    request->send_P(200, "text/html", index_html, processor);
  });
    
  server.on("/logout", HTTP_GET, [](AsyncWebServerRequest *request){
    request->send(401);
  });

  server.on("/logged-out", HTTP_GET, [](AsyncWebServerRequest *request){
    request->send_P(200, "text/html", logout_html, processor);
  });

  // Send a GET request to <ESP_IP>/update?state=<inputMessage>
  server.on("/update", HTTP_GET, [] (AsyncWebServerRequest *request) {
    if(!request->authenticate(http_username, http_password))
      return request->requestAuthentication();
    String inputMessage;
    String inputParam;
    // GET input1 value on <ESP_IP>/update?state=<inputMessage>
    if (request->hasParam(PARAM_INPUT_1)) {
      inputMessage = request->getParam(PARAM_INPUT_1)->value();
      inputParam = PARAM_INPUT_1;
      digitalWrite(output, inputMessage.toInt());
    }
    else {
      inputMessage = "No message sent";
      inputParam = "none";
    }
    Serial.println(inputMessage);
    request->send(200, "text/plain", "OK");
  });
  
  // Start server
  server.begin();
}
  
void loop() {
  
}
```

### How the Code Works?

We have already covered in a previous tutorial how to build an asynchronous web server with sliding buttons to control outputs of the ESP32 module. In this case, we will build an asynchronous web server with only one sliding button to control the GPIO2 of our ESP board. Thus, we will only focus on the code where we are incorporating the HTTP authentication because the rest of the parts are already covered before.

*This code is compatible with both ESP32 and ESP8266 boards except for parts where we are defining the state of the LED. For ESP8266, the onboard LED works on an opposite logic as compared to ESP32. To turn the onboard LED ON, a low signal is sent and to turn it OFF, a high signal is sent. This is the opposite in the case of ESP32.

#### Importing Libraries

Firstly, we will import all the necessary libraries which are required for this project. As this code is compatible with both ESP32 and ESP8266 thus both libraries (  WiFi.h  and ESP8266WiFi.h) are defined. This library will help in establishing the connection between our ESP module to a wireless network. We will also import the two libraries which we installed previously, the ESPAsyncWebServer library and the  ESPAsyncTCP  library.

```c
#ifdef ESP32
  #include <WiFi.h>
  #include <AsyncTCP.h>
#else
  #include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
  #include <ESPAsyncTCP.h>
#endif
#include <ESPAsyncWebServer.h>
```

#### Setting Network Credentials

Next, we will create two global variables, one for the  SSID  and the other for  password. These will hold our network credentials which will be used to connect to our wireless network. Replace both of them with your credentials to ensure a successful connection.

```c
const char* ssid = "ENTER_YOUR_WIFI_NAME";
const char* password = "ENTER_YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";

```

#### Assigning Username and Password

Then, we will assign our username and password in two global variables of type char. These two values are set by default to ‘admin’ but make sure to change them accordingly. Choose a strong password with a mixture of alphabets, numeric characters, and symbols.

```c
const char* http_username = "admin"; //Replace with your own username
const char* http_password = "admin"; //Replace with your own password

```

#### Creating Logout Button

We will create an  index_html  variable to store all the HTML, CSS, and Javascript text which will be required to build our web page. One of the important features in our web server will be the presence of a logout button. We will define it inside the <html><

/html>tags.

```c
<button onclick="logoutButton()">Logout</button>
```

As you can see above, the logout button when clicked will call the  logoutButton()  function. Inside this function, we use the  XMLHttpRequest. This will allow us to make an HTTP request in JavaScript.

```c
function logoutButton() {
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open("GET", "logout", true);
  xhr.send();
  setTimeout(function(){ window.open("/logged-out","_self"); }, 1000);

```

To make the HTTP GET request to our ESP32/ESP8266 three steps will be

followed.

-   Firstly, we will create an XMLHttpRequest as follows:

```c
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
```

-   Secondly, we will initialize the request by using the  xhr.open()  method. Inside it, we will pass on three arguments. The first argument specifies the type of HTTP method which is GET in our case. The second argument is the URL to which are ESP32/ESP8266 will request upon. In our case, it is the string ‘logout’ (URL: /logout). The last argument is true which specifies that the request is asynchronous.

```c
xhr.open("GET", "logout", true);
```

-   Lastly, we will use  xhr.send()  to open the connection. Our server (ESP32/ESP8266) will now be able to receive the HTTP GET request whenever the logout button will be clicked.

```c
xhr.send();
```

The following line makes sure that only after a delay of 1 second (1000ms) you will be redirected to the  /logged-out  URL. This will happen when the user will click the logout button.

```c
  setTimeout(function(){ window.open("/logged-out","_self"); }, 1000);
```

#### Handling Requests with Authentication

Now, comes the important part where the web server will check for user authentication before processing each request. Whenever we will make a request to our ESP board to open the web server it will check for username and password which we defined in the code. The following lines of code will be added after each request.

```c
if(!request->authenticate(http_username, http_password))
    return request->requestAuthentication();

```

In these lines, you can see that if the username and password are not correct then the browser will keep on prompting until the correct credentials are entered.

#### Handling Logout Button

Previously, we created the logout button and configured the  HTTP GET request. Now, we will handle what will happen when the ESP32/ESP8266 receives the request on the /logout and the /logged-out URL.

After you click the logout button you will be redirected to the /logout URL as you can see below. We will use the  on()  method on the server object to listen to the incoming HTTP requests and execute functions accordingly. The  send()  method will be used to return the HTTP response. The response code  401  will be sent to the client, whenever the server will receive a request on the “/logout” URL. This 401 code denotes an unauthorized client error. Thus, the webpage will log out and you will have to enter the username and password again to access the webserver.

```c
server.on("/logout", HTTP_GET, [](AsyncWebServerRequest *request){
  request->send(401);
});

```

Next, we also have to deal with the /logged-out URL request which the ESP board will receive after a delay of 1 second. Now, we will use the  send_P()  method. The handling function will respond to the client by using the  send_P()  method on the request object. This method will take in four parameters. The first is  200  which is the HTTP status code for ‘ok’. The second is “text/html” which will correspond to the content type of the response. The third input is the text saved on the logout_html variable. Finally, the last parameter is the processor function which will be sent as the response. Thus, the logout page will be built when the ESP32/ESP8266 will receive the /logout request.

```c
server.on("/logged-out", HTTP_GET, [](AsyncWebServerRequest *request){
  request->send_P(200, "text/html", logout_html, processor);
});

```
