# Aim
DC Motor Interfacing using 8051 Microcontroller
<br>

# Purpose
rotate DC Motor in clockwise and anti clockwise direction
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Proteus 8
AT89C51 Microcontroller

2 DC Motor

Wires

ICL29D

switches
<br>


# Workflow
Project has 4 switches
when first switch is on then the both Dc Motor connected will rotate in clockwise direction.

when 2nd switch is on then only right Dc motor runs in clockwise direction.

when 3rd switch is on then ony left Dc motor runs in clockwise direction

when 4th switch is on then both dc motor connected will rotate in anti clockwise direction.

we can add 5th switch to stop.But I have made on forever so that when other switch in of condition it automatically stop the rotation of dc switch.

# Setup 
Connect the circuit diagram as shown in the image and press the simulation button then play with switches to see different output
