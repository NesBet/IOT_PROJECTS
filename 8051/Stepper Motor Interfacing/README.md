# Aim
Stepper Motor Interfacing using 8051 Microcontroller
<br>

# Purpose
rotate Stepper Motor in clockwise and anti clockwise direction
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Proteus 8

AT89C51 Microcontroller

Stepper Motor

Wires

ICULN2003A

switches
<br>


# Workflow
we choose 3 rotating angles for stepper motor (0,180,270,360).

if we start from 0deg and move in sequence then stepper motor rotates in clockwise direction.

if we move in reverse direction, that is from 360deg to 0deg then stepper motor rotates in anti clock wise.

we use 2 switches
switch1 deals with turning on and off the stepper motor.

switch 2 deals with direction of the stepper motor.

we use for loop and move from 0deg to 360deg when switch2 is off else we use reverse loop to move from 360deg to 0deg.

# Setup 
Connect the circuit diagram as shown in the image and Turn on the stepper motor.

if the rotation switch is turned off then stepper motor moves in clockwise direction.

if switch is turned on then it moves in anti-clockwise direction
