To perform this experiment using software only :-

->Wokwi simulator on the web provides a simulator for Raspberry Pi Pico

->We need Embedded C for programming the Raspberry Pi Pico to perform the blinking LED experiment.

->The required hardware objects i.e., LED and Wires are included in the simulator.


To perform this experiment using hardware :-

->We need a Raspberry Pi Pico

->Install Arduino IDE to write and flash the C code onto the Raspberry Pi Pico.

->We need 1 Red LED and 3 Green LEDs to perform the experiment.

->The connections of anode of the LEDs is to be done according to the pin assigned to them in the LED Blinking Code

->Ground the cathode of all the LEDS to the GND pin of the Raspberry Pi Pico.
